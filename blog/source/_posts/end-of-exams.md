Just finished the end of my exams for my first semester of 4th year, and my my, how stressful that was! No matter the course, final exams always cause me so much worry and stress. The culmination of 12 weeks of classes into one small 2-3 hour test, is kind of nerve wracking and mind boggling to say the least. Especially when specific courses have a final thats worth 35-45% of your final mark.

I find after all my exams are finished, like it is now, it is even more stressful then the few days of studying. Waiting for those final grades to be posted, is brought along with a sense of doom even though I probably did well. Thinking about how the last few months of learning have just ended abruptly and my whole learning experience has culminated in waiting around for judgment.

Ugh, school. I can't wait to get back into the workforce, where I know the only stress I'll have to worry about is maybe the stress of an impending deadline.
