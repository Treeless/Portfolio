Starting a blog is the weirdest thing, what do I say?

Hey, my name is Matt. I have been coding for around 5 years now. I began coding in 2012 as a student at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario. Living at home at the time, I took their advanced diploma Computer Programmer Analyst course which was a 3 year course with 3 co-op workterms. I came to the college having no coding experience or knowledge about the inner workings of computers but like most programmers, I played alot of video games which helped peak my interest in the field of IT.

At Georgian, through classes was exposed to `Python`, `C`, `C#`, `Java`, `Asp.net`, `Html5, Css3, JavaScript`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `DB2`, `COBOL`.
