Hey there, my name is Matthew Rowlandson. I have been in the coding and IT space for around 5 years now.

My coding career began in 2012 as a college student at Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario. Living at home at the time, I attended their advanced diploma Computer Programmer Analyst course which consisted of a 3 year course including 3 co-op workterms. I came to the college having had no coding experience or knowledge about the inner workings of computers. However like most programmers; I played a lot of video games which helped peak my interest in the field of IT.

At Georgian, through various classes, I was exposed to: `Python`, `C`, `C#`, `Java`, `Asp.net`, `Html5, Css3, JavaScript`, `PHP`, `MySQL`, `DB2`, `COBOL` and many other coding languages. My first co-op workterm was with the Department of Defense working at Base Borden on their technical support service desk, answering phones, driving around the base fullfilling service tickets. My second and third coop were at One More Story Games, initially as a junior programmer and later becoming the team lead managing 8 other student developers. Georgian really gave me a solid foundation for my programming skills and exposed me to a good variety of coding opportunities. I'm super happy I choose the hands on college route rather then heading directly to university. As a result of my schooling and workterm opportunities I deviated towards JavaScript and web application development. Working with AngularJS 1.x and NodeJS alongside MongoDB became my preferred programming stack.

Following Georgian, I acquired a position working as an Intermediate Software Developer at gShift in Barrie. gShift supplies an SEO web based platform for agencies and enterprise level clients to manage their online presence. I worked with both a combination of the MEAN stack as well as Ruby On Rails. Using mostly self taught experience with the MEAN stack to integrate a newly acquired appliction into the main corporate web app. I worked at gShift for 10 months, learning many new things and working with a fantastic team of programmers. But in the end, I felt like I was missing something, so I decided to go back to School and aiming towards a Computer Science Degree to further extend my education background.

I decided to apply to Trent University due to their fantastic 2 year bridge agreement they have between Georgian College. Basically I was able to enter right into 3rd year  by transferring in half the required credits. This leads to taking only a 2 year program and coming out with a 4 year Computer Science degree with honours. As of writing this, I am currently currently finishing up my 1st semester of year 4 and have only one more semester to go before graduating in 2018.

Longterm I hope to continue working on personal projects during my free time and plan on travelling the world while I work remotely. An ambitious plan, but like most digital nomads, it all starts with a dream.

I'm going to be using this blog as a medium where I can talk about programming, my interests and what projects I'm working on. I'm sure the blog will evolve as I go, but i'm looking forward to blogging about my life and experiences.

Thanks for reading!
