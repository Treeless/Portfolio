Currently its getting to be the end of my first semester of 4th year at TrentU as a Computer Science major, and exams are just around the corner. Even with all the stress and last minute assignment work, something has been bothering me about University, and maybe it is just Trent in particular, but I doubt it is.

There are some great professors here, ones that care about the content they are lecturing about. Those who spend the time to give good feedback, and actually care about their students future prospects. These are the professors that students come to university for, they are experts in their fields and are willing to share their experiences alongside giving fantastic explanations on well thought out content, that THEY have made. Don't get me wrong, I love these professors.

Now, flash over to the other side of the spectrum, there are many professors (especially those in upper year courses), who don't care about any of the content they are teaching, they come to lectures with no intent of providing value to students and just read off of slides downloaded from the internet. They expect you to understand and memorize content that has next to no benefit in the real world and when it comes to assignments, they are just work for the sake of work. These professors have no understanding on what information is actually useful from their course, but come to their own conclusions without having any actual experience with their content. These are the professors that I cannot stand. I don't understand how the university can hire these professors without properly vetting them and tend to just keep these 'professors' around because they have a fancy piece of paper (masters or phd etc).

This is a little bit of a rant.. following a fundamentals of operating systems class where our 'professor' decides to talk for 5 minutes and then say that "the class is over. Go home and read the content. Study for the exam. Its been a pleasure 'teaching' you....", and here I am thinking, :hey, this 5 minutes just cost me freaking $150"; considering most classes are $800 or so a semester...

Well, I suppose I'll just keep on keeping on. Get through my exams and final semester this winter. Afterwards I know I wont have to pay money to learn a mix of non benificial mumbojumbo. That being said, I am still continuing to code on my own time and explore my own tech interests. So I'm happy to say I'm learning lots during downtime between classes and as a bonus, at least my self learning education is free.
