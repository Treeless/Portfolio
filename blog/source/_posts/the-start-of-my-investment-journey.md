Coming out of college, I was lucky to land a position working as an intermediate software developer at a company called gShift in Barrie, Ontario. I worked there for 10 months, before I decided to head to university. The money I made at gShift was pretty great for a recent college grad, and as a result I had a little bit of money saved up. I didn't think the 0.5-1% savings interest was going to cut it; I wanted to find somewhere I could make my money work for me. I had heard about investing in stocks on youtube and from friends and it sounded quite scary to be honest. There are lots of unknowns in the investment world, and as a new comer, it was quite overwhelming but also exilerating.

I opened up a Questrade account in 2015, opening both an RRSP and a TFSA. In order to start using these accounts, I had to first send some documents and ID verifiction to them, and a few weeks later, I had to deposit $1000 into each of the accounts to start trading with them. I choose Questrade as my stock broker for a few reasons, first they had some of the lowest commission rates per trade; $4.95 - $9.95 a trade. Secondly, they were well known for their great trading platform and had some solid online reviews. Looking back, I wouldn't choose any other broker and would still go with Questrade.

My first investment I made was in Ascent Solar Technoligies ($ASTI), which at the time, was trading on the NASDAQ exchange. I purchased 250 shares at ~1.30 a piece. Not really knowing what I was doing, and having heard solar was taking off. I invested without doing an due diligence or research on the company. A rookie mistake for sure...
That first investment later tanked. The stock price got so low that the company did a stock split, that didn't help and the stock ended up getting pushed off the NASDAQ exchange and demoted to the over the counter PINX exchange. At the current date of writing this, the shares I own in $ASTI are 30, and worth 0.0009 cents a piece, I didn't sell them and I still have it in my portfolio as a reminder of my bad investment.
