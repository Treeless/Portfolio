Coming out of college, I was lucky to land a position working as an <em>Intermediate Software Developer</em> at an SEO company, gShift located in Barrie, Ontario. I worked there for 10 months, before I decided to head to university and extend my education background. The money I made at gShift was pretty great for a recent college grad, and as a result I had a little bit of money set aside. However, I didn't think the 0.5-1% savings interest from my bank was going to cut it; I wanted to find somewhere I could make my money work for me. Having heard about investing in the stock market on youtube and from friends in the past, I decided to look into it a bit more. From what I read, it did sound quite scary but that didn't stop me. There are lots of unknowns in the investment world, and as a new comer, it can be quite overwhelming, but as long as you're open to learning, it's a fantastic way to grow your money.

I opened up a <a href="https://www.questrade.com">Questrade</a> account in 2015, opening both an RRSP and a TFSA. In order to start using these accounts, I had to first send some documents and ID verifiction to Questrade, and a few weeks later, I had to deposit $1000 into each of the accounts in order to start trading with them. I choose Questrade as my stock broker for a few reasons, first they had some of the lowest commission rates per trade; $4.95 - $9.95 a trade. Secondly, they were well known for their great trading platform and had some solid online reviews. Looking back, I wouldn't choose any other broker and would still go with Questrade as I've had nothing but good experience with the platform.

Initially my first investment I made was in Ascent Solar Technoligies ($ASTI), which at the time, was trading on the NASDAQ exchange. I purchased 250 shares at ~1.30 a piece. Not really knowing what I was doing, but having heard the solar industry was taking off. I invested without doing any due diligence or research on the company. A rookie mistake for sure...
Flash forward a few months later, that investment had tanked. The stock price got plummetted so low that the company did a stock split (where they dillute their shares by removing or adding shares), that didn't help and the stock ended up getting pushed off the NASDAQ exchange and demoted the over the counter PINX exchange. At the current date of writing this, the number of shares I own in $ASTI are 30, and worth 0.0009 cents a piece. I didn't sell these shares as it would cost more to sell them then they are worth. I still have the position in my portfolio as a reminder of my bad investment, but hey, that was a good learning experience.

In future posts, I plan on talking a bit more about the investments I currently have and my view of the stock market.
