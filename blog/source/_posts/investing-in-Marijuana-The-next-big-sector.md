Marijuana has been in use in our society for a long, long time. The fact that it has been illegal, hasn't really stopped the general population from using the substance. There are a few preconceived notions in our society that weed is a gateway drug, or that it is bad for you. Studies have shown otherwise however. I don't know about you (reader), but thinking back to all the people I've known in my life. There are a good amount of people who have tried or used weed in some fashion or another. Edibles, vaping, smoking, you name it. Its pretty commonplace in our society even if you don't see it as often as other substances such as alcohol. Its anonymity is due to having to procure it from the black market. However, times are changing, weed is being brought into the legal spotlight and for good reason; MONEY. Taxes from alcohol bring in a large amount of money for the government. Weed will do that same or even bring more money with taxes and also help to spur the economy.

With the global market of alcohol having global sales estimated at <em>1.163 trillion dollars</em> a year <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/story/12844252/1/six-alcohol-industry-stocks-to-consider-for-your-stock-portfolio.html">(source)</a>, marijuana sales have the opportunity to possibly reach a similar level in the future. The possibilities with Marijuana far exceed that of alcohol, with health, research, food, possibilities that alcohol never had access to.

With Marijuana becoming legalized in Canada in and around July 2018, and with all the possibilities, I believe it is going to become the next big sector that if you are able to invest in early enough, will pay off very well in the future. Canada is leading the way with full legalization. The USA has yet (as of this writing) to have federally legalized marijuana and most other countries have only decriminalized or allowed medical marijuana. With Canada becoming legal, Canadian licensed producers (LPs) are going to be at the forefront of the global marijuana market, having had time to invest in infrastructure and partnerships. This places investments in these companies at a forefront with almost positive future growth with leads to more money for investors.

A word of caution however, there are many small companies trying to get on the bandwagon of Marijuana legalization, these companies say amazing things, but having nothing to show for their words. When doing due diligence and research, always ensure companies you are researching can backup their claims with hard proof. Videos, interviews, etc that show hard evidence are what you should be looking for.

Now, here are some of my favorite Canadian weed stocks as of this writing:

Anything beyond the big three do come with a bit of a risk, however I believe longterm, most of, if not all licensed producers, will do well once legalization comes to fruition. The demand for products will speak for itself; there won't be enough weed to go around. Jump on board the investment train before its too late! Pick a few of the largest LPs you can find and invest what you can before the marijuana gains train leaves the station and the price per share is too high to invest.
