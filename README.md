DOMAIN: matthewrowlandson.com

Setup blogging system with firebase and angular. Use it to create a collaborative blogging platform of my own.
This would be a solid project to work on during my spare time here at university. The blog can be under a subdomain of 'blog.matthewrowlandson.com'. 

Blog will require:
> Authentication
> Blog posting
> Follow/search of users
> User profiles
> Like
> Commenting
> Sharing (social media)
> Ads (monitization)
